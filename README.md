## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic **HTML5**
- **CSS3** custom properties
- **Flexbox**
- **Mobile-first** workflow
- Media Queries for responsiveness

### What I Learned

During this project, I gained more confidence in:

- Structuring semantic HTML with clarity
- Using `object-fit: cover` for responsive images
- Creating responsive layouts using `max-width` and `media queries`
- Applying consistent spacing with `gap`, `margin`, and `padding`

Hereâ€™s a snippet I liked:

```css
.article img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
  display: block;
}
